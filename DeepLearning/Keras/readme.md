#Keras

### Keras guilding principles

Modularity: a model can be understood as a sequence or a graph alone. All the concers of deep learning model are discrete components that can be combined in arbitrary ways

Minimalism: just enough to achieve an outcome, no frills and maximizing readability

Extensibility: components are intentionally easy to add and use within the framework

Python: no separate model files with custom file formats, so native Python
